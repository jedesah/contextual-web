# Writing your first interpolator

## The Basics

Most of us have a familiar workflow for writing code: we write the source, we
compile it, and then we run it. Designing an interpolator, however, typically
requires writing some code which will be run at runtime, and some code which
will run during a later compilation. Whilst this new workflow isn't
complicated, it is less familiar, so we should be careful to understand it
before continuing.

When we design an interpolator, we would like to check the validity of the
